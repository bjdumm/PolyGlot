# PolyGlot
Simple wxPython app for studying vocabulary across multiple languages at once

The goal for this project was to create a simple app that is also useful in order to get experience creating GUIs in Python.
The wxPython package was used to create the user interface. Automatic translations for the words is carried out by calling the Google Translate
services provided through the GoogleTrans Python package.

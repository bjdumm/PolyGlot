# PolyGlot
Simple wxPython app for studying vocabulary across multiple languages at once
---
The goal for this project was to create a simple app that is also useful in order to get experience creating GUIs in Python. 
The user interface was created using wxPython. The automatic translations for the words is carried out by calling the Google Translate
services provided through the GoogleTrans Python package. These translation aren't perfect because the context isn't always inferred correctly, so
manual insertion is sometimes required. 

## Who is the app for?

The app is for anyone wanting to study large amounts of vocabulary all at once in any number of languages. There are many great apps for grammar and pronounciation, but I needed an app that let's you study vocabulary as fast as you can and not one phrase or word at a time. It's helpful for anyone
who needs to learn or review several languages and would like to be able to do so in parallel.
